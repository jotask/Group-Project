Matters arising
1. The initial prototype for TaskerMAN, TaskerCLI and the database have all been demonstrated and feedback has been given.  TaskerCLI was said to be showing too many properties similar to what TaskerMAN is required to have.  TaskerMAN was criticised for not yet having any functionality with the database interaction.  The database will need to implement automatic incrementing for ID numbers.


New Business
2. Improvements to the prototype will need to be made alongside fully completing implementation and testing of the final system before the next deadline
